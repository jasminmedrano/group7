              I am a Whale Shark.
              <br>
              I am the largest shark and one of the largest fishes alive!
              <br>
              I can weigh up to 11 tons and grow to 40 feet big.
              <br>
               I can be found in all tropical oceans.
              <br>
              Yet, due to humans poaching my species for my meat, fins, and oil in the international market.
              <br>
              Along with pollution and tourism that are being a threat to my species.
              <br>
              Our population is slowly decreasing. There is 238,000 left of us.
